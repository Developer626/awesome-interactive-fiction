==== ADRIFT

* http://www.adrift.co/[www.adrift.co^]

ADRIFT (Adventure Development & Runner -- Interactive Fiction Toolkit) is a GUI driven IF development system for Windows, allowing to create text adventures via dialog boxes and GUI controls instead of writing code. Supports graphics and sounds.

Developed by Campbell Wild since 1997, ADRIFT Developer (formerly called Adventure Generator) used to be a commercial product, but since 2011 has been released as freeware.

There are different versions of ADRIFT, and an adventure created with a specific version of ADRIFT Developer needs to be played with the same version of ADRIFT Runner:

* *ADRIFT 5.0* (2011–)
* *ADRIFT 4.0* (2002–2012)
* *ADRIFT 3.9* (2001)
* *ADRIFT 2.0* (aka Adventure Generator, 1997) -- legacy 16-bit DOS app
