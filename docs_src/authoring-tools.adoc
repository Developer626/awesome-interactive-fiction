ADRIFT (Adventure Development & Runner -- Interactive Fiction Toolkit) is a GUI driven IF development system for Windows, allowing to create text adventures via dialog boxes and GUI controls instead of writing code. Supports graphics and sounds.

Developed by Campbell Wild since 1997, ADRIFT Developer (formerly called Adventure Generator) used to be a commercial product, then in 2011 it became freeware, and now the full source code is available on GitHub under BSD 3-Clause license.

There are different versions of ADRIFT, adventures created with a specific version of ADRIFT Developer should be played with the same version of ADRIFT Runner -- but ADRIFT Runner 5 should be able to run adventures created for v4:

* *ADRIFT 5.0* (2011–)
* *ADRIFT 4.0* (2002–2012)
* *ADRIFT 3.9* (2001)
* *ADRIFT 2.0* (aka Adventure Generator, 1997) -- legacy 16-bit DOS app
