# Contributors' Guidelines

You can contribute to the __Awesome Interactive Fiction__ list via:

- [pull requests][X-PRs]
- [issues][X-issues]

The former contribution method is the preferred one, for you'll be directly contributing your contents to the [AsciiDoc] source files; but it's more indicated for those willing to collaborate to the project on the long run, for it requires some initial setup steps, and knowledge of AsciiDoc.

Issues are useful for discussion and planning, but can also be used to propose new material by those who don't know AsciiDoc, or simply wish to propose adding a link and don't want to go through all the trouble of forking the repository.

# Submitting Contents via Pull Requests

The source files of the __Awesome IF__ document are stored inside:

- [`/docs_src/`][docs_src]

For editing convenience, the (rather long) __Awesome IF__ document was split into multiple files — one file per document section. (More info in [`/docs_src/README.md`][README md]).

The [`README.adoc`][README ad] file that you see in the repository main page is generated by preprocessing all the source files into a single [AsciiDoc] document, so that visitors landing on the repository will be presented with a preview of the full __Awesome IF__ document. This duplicate document is necessary because [GitHub does not currently support AsciiDoc `include::` directives][#1095].

> __IMPORTANT__ — You should not edit the [`README.adoc`][README ad] file, for all changes would be overwritten when the project is updated. Edit its source files in [`/docs_src/`][docs_src] instead.

## System Requirements

### Asciidoctor Ruby

Source documents are in [AsciiDoc] format, designed for [Asciidoctor]  (Ruby), so you'll need to install the [Asciidoctor Ruby gem] on your machine to be able to build and preview the edited document.

### EditorConfig

This repository relies on [EditorConfig] to enforce consisted code styles across different editors.
If your editor doesn't natively support EditorConfig, you should [find and install a third party plug-in].

EditorConfig validation of the project files is carried out via [EClint] (Node.js):

    $ eclint check

Ideally, you should also install [EClint] via NPM, in order to check that all files pass the test before submitting a pull request — but neither of these are mandatory, just highly recommended to help preserve code consistency.

[find and install a third party plug-in]: https://editorconfig.org/#download "See the list of editors supporting EditorConfig"

# Proposing Contents via Issues

The [repository issues] can be freely used to propose new links, discuss the project, offer advise, ask questions, or anything else that is related to the project goals — there are no strict rules regarding issues, for it's unlikely that this project will ever end up being sumberged in thousands of pending issues.

In the long term, it's likely that most contributions will come via issues, from visitors who noticed that some resources are not listed, and [open an issue] to mention their omission and provide links to them.
